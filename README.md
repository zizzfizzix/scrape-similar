# Scrape Similar

A powerful browser extension for extracting structured data from websites and exporting to Google Sheets, Excel (.xlsx), CSV, TSV, or the clipboard. Built with **WXT**, Vite, React 19, TypeScript, and Manifest V3 WebExtension APIs.

## 🚀 Installation

**For end-users:** Download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bhgobenflkkhfcgkikejaaejenoddcmo)

Currently only tested in Chrome. Pre-built packages for all major browsers (Chromium, Firefox, & Edge) will be published at a later time. Until then, you can build the extension locally.

### Build from source

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.0.0
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- A modern browser (Chromium-based, Firefox, or Edge) for testing

> For a deep dive on setting up a new project or migrating an existing one to **WXT**, see the official installation guide: [WXT ‑ Installation](https://wxt.dev/guide/installation.html).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zizzfizzix/scrape-similar.git
   cd scrape-similar
   ```

2. Install dependencies and prepare WXT:

   ```bash
   pnpm install       # or npm install
   pnpm postinstall   # runs `wxt prepare` so the dev server recognises entrypoints
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with automatic browser-reloading (WXT dev)
pnpm dev            # or npm run dev

# Target a specific browser in dev mode (e.g. Firefox)
pnpm dev:firefox    # or npm run dev:firefox

# Production build
pnpm build          # or npm run build

# Production build for Firefox (adds sources.zip required by AMO)
pnpm build:firefox

# Create zipped packages for submission
a) Generic zip        -> pnpm zip
b) Firefox zip & src  -> pnpm zip:firefox

# Submit a release programmatically (requires .env.submit)
pnpm wxt submit --chrome-zip .output/*-chrome.zip --firefox-zip .output/*-firefox.zip
```

_For the full list of available commands (`build -b`, `zip -b`, `submit`, etc.) consult the [official WXT docs](https://wxt.dev/guide/installation.html)._

### Browser Extension Development Mode

Most modern browsers allow loading unpacked extensions while in developer/debug mode:

1. Open your browser’s extensions management page and enable developer/debug mode.
2. Select “Load unpacked” (or the equivalent option) and choose the `build` directory generated by the dev or build command.
3. The extension will now be loaded and ready for testing.

└── wxt.config.ts        # WXT configuration
```

### Key Technologies

- **Extension framework**: [WXT](https://wxt.dev/)
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn-ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Build Tooling**: Vite
- **Analytics**: PostHog (privacy-focused)
- **WebExtension APIs**: Manifest V3, service workers

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer functional components with React hooks
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs
- Follow the established project structure

#### Web Extension Best Practices

- Use Manifest V3 features and patterns
- Abstract browser-specific extension APIs with WXT
- Implement proper error handling for WebExtension APIs
- Follow the principle of least privilege for permissions
- Use event-driven service workers for background tasks

#### State Management

- Use React’s `useState` and `useReducer` for component state
- Persist data with the `storage` WebExtension API through [WXT storage](https://wxt.dev/storage.html)
- Use message passing for cross-context communication

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

- Test on various website types (e-commerce, blogs, portfolios)
- Verify all export formats work correctly
- Test Google Sheets integration with different data sizes
- Verify visual picker functionality and keyboard shortcuts
- Test context menu quick scrape functionality

### Debugging

- Use your browser’s DevTools for debugging
- Inspect the background service worker console
- Monitor network requests in the Network tab
- Enable the extension’s built-in debug mode

## 📦 Building for Production

WXT wraps Vite so the standard build pipeline is still available, but the preferred workflow is via WXT’s CLI helpers:

```bash
# Multi-browser release build
pnpm build                # Chromium-compatible output in .output
pnpm build:firefox        # Adds Firefox-flavoured output
```

The resulting files are placed in the `.output` directory. Each variant can then be zipped with `pnpm zip` or `pnpm zip:<browser>` before uploading to the respective store.

## 🚀 Publishing

WXT ships with powerful automation for packaging and submitting new versions:

1. Generate ZIP(s) for the browsers you plan to publish. Example:

   ```bash
   pnpm zip                # Chrome / Edge package
   pnpm zip:firefox        # Firefox package *and* mandatory sources zip
   ```

2. (Optional) Use `pnpm wxt submit` to programmatically upload each ZIP to its store. See the [Publishing guide](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/publishing.html) for required environment variables and advanced CI setups.
3. Safari is not yet fully automated. If you target Safari, follow Apple’s `safari-web-extension-converter` flow as described in the [WXT Safari notes](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/publishing.html#safari). WXT can still output a Safari-ready bundle via:

   ```bash
   pnpm wxt build -b safari
   ```

> Need continuous delivery? Copy the GitHub Actions workflow in the WXT docs to zip and submit on every version tag.
